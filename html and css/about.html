                    <p> Hi! My name is Barbara Sanchez, I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. I am daughter of an Electrical Engineer and a Lawyer. I have three older sisters. My family gave me a loving home and a lot of values. I have great memories from my childhood, I was fortunate to being able to enjoy living in the countryside because I grew up in a city near the beach before moving at ten years old to the capital of my country Caracas. <br><br>
                        As long as I can remember I enjoy using and learning how to use all types of technologies; so after high school I decided to study Computer Science, which I loved!. Then I change University after I moved to another city and Studied Psychology. I am married since 2012 to an amazing Man who is a Systems Engineer, and we have a beautiful 5 years old son name Santiago. <br> <br>
                        I am extremely grateful to being born in Venezuela. My country has the most beautiful beaches and paradise places to visit. Venezuelans are extremely kind and have a great sense of humor. In my country we have amazing typical food such as Arepas, Cachapas, Pabellon Criollo and Teque√±os. I hope after reading this you decide to visit Venezuela in your next holidays. <br> <br>
                        Since 2018 I live in Munich, Germany with my family. Munich is a great city to live in, here you are able to be close with the nature while also living in a big metropolitan city. While living here I was told about Redi School and its Digital Career Program and decided to apply. I am extremely grateful with Redi School, they have the most amazing teachers that teach with such passion and joy that make you fall in love with what you learn, not only they have giving me the tools to find a career in IT but also guidance along the way with their Mentorship Program. 
                       <br> <br>I am looking forward to continuing my studies at Redi School. I am Redi!    </p>
