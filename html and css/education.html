                    <p> Redi School was founded in 2016 with the premise that technology can bring people together to build new
                        solutions to old problems. With the high demand for qualified professionals in the IT sector, they 
                        decided that this is an opportunity for newcomers who are eager to lern and contribute to Germany's 
                        society. They offer free courses to newcomers and to Germans with a high interest in pursuing a career 
                        in the technology field. All of this is possible thanks to the help of many IT professionals who donate 
                        their time to teach valuable digital skills to the students. The process of selection begins with 
                        an Open Day or info session, then applying in the website, then you will get an invite for a short 
                        interview and possibly a small quiz on your skills (in case you want to participate in a higher
                        level course) then you will get a confirmation when you are accepted. </p>

                            <h2>My Experience at Redi School</h2> 
                        </div>
                    <p>A friend of mine told me about Redi and how the program works and I couldn't believe what I was hearing, this meant
                        so much hope for me, because it offers me the opportunity to make my dream of working in IT a reality. I register to get the chance
                        to enter the selection process. I join the Redi Student Info Session where they explain how the entire selection process, then it was
                        the Redi Orientation Session where they helped me choose which course was best for me. I applied for the course Introduction to Computer Science 
                        in the Digital Career Program; then it was time for the Interview, and after a week I've got the acceptation e-mail. I remember feeling so grateful
                        and motivated. 
                        We had the Kick Off Session where we got the opportunity to talk to our teachers and meet our classmates. They had prepared a challenge for us,
                        we had to make Robot, a description of what the abilities of the robot and a GIF. We name our robot FRIEND-O-MATIC, it has a superpower of encourage us
                        and help you not to give up. We had a lot of fun building it and great seeing everyone working as a team. 
                        During the course we learned so much: Bash Commands, Python, HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript. We had a lot of homework, really creative ones that really help us practice 
                        everything that we learned during the classes. We had amazing teachers fill with so much passion for what they
                        are doing that made me fell in love with programming all over again. Thank you Cata, Djalel and Stefan, for taking time out your busy schedules to teach us 
                        and also big thank you to Tatyana and Christoph. We also had workshops during the semester, technical and also to improve our soft skills, I enjoy them a lot
                        they really offer relevant information from how to find a job and make the best CV to Natural Language Processing, IoT and Mobile Development. 
                        There's also a Mentorship Program, this initiative is extremely helpful, not only you have the chance to speak to someone who already made it in IT but 
                        your Mentor is there for you, they guide you, teach you and prepare you. Thank you so much Redi School, I can't wait until the next semester begins.
