            <h3>My Experience with Redi School</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>What is Redi School?</h4>
            <p2> Redi School was founded in 2016 with the premise that technology can bring people together to build new
                 solutions to old problems. With the high demand for qualified professionals in the IT sector, they 
                 decided that this is an opportunity for newcomers who are eager to lern and contribute to Germany's 
                 society. They offer free courses to newcomers and to Germans with a high interest in pursuing a career 
                 in the technology field. All of this is possible thanks to the help of many IT professionals who donate 
                 their time to teach valuable digital skills to the students. The process of selection begins with 
                 an Open Day or info session, then applying in the website, then you will get an invite for a short 
                 interview and possibly a small quiz on your skills (in case you want to participate in a higher
                 level course) then you will get a confirmation when you are accepted.</p2><br>
